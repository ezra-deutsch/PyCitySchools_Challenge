# PyCitySchools - Module 4 - Challenge

## Overview of Project

The PyCitySchools project is an in-depth analysis of school district data using the Pandas library in Python. Data from separate CSV files are read into Pandas and merged to create multiple different dataframes and analyzed.

### Purpose

The PyCitySchools school district needs to analyze the student testing data for all schools. They have asked for our help to identify Thomas High School, change some of their testing results, and report all overall district statistics.  

## Results

(See image below)
This analysis required us to use the loc method, logical, and comparison operators to filter and replace all the 9th grade math and reading scores for Thomas High School to NaNs.

## Summary

The academic dishonesty and subsequent removal of Thomas High Schools ninth grade math and reading scores changed the schools metrics slightly. It did not, however change the school's ranking among the other schools in the district. Changes were measured in the Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and % Overall Passing.
