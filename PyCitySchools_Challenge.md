# PyCitySchools - Module 4 - Challenge

## Overview of Project

The PyCitySchools project is an indepth analysis of school district data using the Pandas library in Python. Data from separate CSV files are read into Pandas and merged to create multiple different dataframes and analyzed.

### Purpose

The PyCitySchools school district needs to analyze the student testing data for all schools. They have asked for our help to identify Thomas High School, change some of their testing results, and report all overall district statistics.  

## Results

Deliverable #1

(See image below)
This analysis required us to use the loc method, logical, and comparison operators to filter and replace all the 9th grade math and reading scores for Thomas High School to NaNs.

Deliverable #2

How is the district summary affected?
How is the school summary affected?
How does placing the 9th graders' math and reading scores affect THS's performance relative to the other schools?
How does replacing the 9th grade scores affect the following:
	Math and reading scores by grade?
	Scores by school spending
	Scores by school size
	Socres by school type

Deliverable #3

There is a bulleted list that addresses how each of the 7 school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data (10pts)

Adding, removing, or changing underlying data can have adverse affects on certain metrics. The school district looks at certain metrics to rank schools. Below is a list of each metric and the affects of changing the underlying data.

*1.
*2.
*3. Avg Math Score - unaffected because when scores are removed from an average the are also removed from the popluation

*4. Avg Reading Score - unaffected because when scores are removed from an average the are also removed from the popluation

*5. % Passing Math - removing scores will change the metric depending on how many met the passing % requirement. 
*6. % Passing Reading - removing scores will change the metric depending on how many met the passing % requirement. 
*7. % Overall Passing - removing scores will change the metric depending on how many met the passing % requirement. 


## Summary

Summarize four changes in the updated school distrcit analysis after reading and math scores for the 9th grade at THS have been replaced with NaNs. (5pts)

There is a statement summarizing 4 changes to the school district analysis after reading and math scores have been replaced. (5pts)
